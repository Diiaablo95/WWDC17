 ## What is CoreImage?
 [Core Image](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/CoreImaging/ci_intro/ci_intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001185-CH1-TPXREF101) is a framework produced by Apple and has a lot of cool and very useful features for dealing with image editing, filtering and processing.
 Among all the features, CoreImage allows *auto-enhancement* for images, *detection of faces* in an image or video, and provides several [filters](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/) to *modify colors*, *distort* a picture or *adjust geometries* of an image.




 Here we are going to see just a small subset of filters that CoreImage provides, but in order to test them out, CoreImage needs a photo to operate. So **select a picture you want to play with, then make sure to run the code at least once**, otherwise you won't be able to test out filters in the next page.

 
 You can come back later to this page if you wish to change the picture.
 
 A suggestion: *a picture of a person or an animal will be way more funny ðŸ˜„!*
